# NATURAL-LANGUAGE-PROCESSING-TEXT-CLASSIFICATION-
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of computer science—and more specifically, the branch of artificial intelligence or AI—concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

Text classification is a machine learning technique that assigns a set of predefined categories to open-ended text. Text classifiers can be used to organize, structure, and categorize pretty much any kind of text – from documents, medical studies and files, and all over the web.
Several model architectures can be used to perform cuisine classification. Some of the most popular, in increasing order of complexity, are SVMs (Pouladzadeh et al., 2015), BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) or GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) models.but here we are going to  use logistic regression.
before apply regression we will convert data into machine level by using countvectorizer,tfidftranformer and tfidfvectorizer.
all the three algorithms will be combined in order to decrease the processing time.
additionally we will be saving the model as well.
